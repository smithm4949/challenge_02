## Authors and acknowledgment

This homework assignment was completed by Myles Smith. There were no files supplied as starter
code, however a public css reset was used from [https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/)

## Project status

This project is feature complete according to the rubric (acceptance criteria) supplied. However,
I plan to continue adding to and improving this page. I am not satisfied with the layout, particularly the work gallery, and need to think through how I want it to display.
